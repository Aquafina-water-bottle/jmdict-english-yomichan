# Local Audio Server for Yomichan

This is a completely optional setup for people who want to be
able to create Anki cards nearly instantaneously, and without
a working internet connection.

> **Warning**:
> I did NOT make these plugins, and cannot provide detailed support for when things go wrong.
> Credits are given in the respective folders, and at the bottom of this guide.



<details>
<summary>Advantages and Disadvantages of using this setup <i>(click here)</i></summary>


* **Advantages:**

    1. Most audio is gotten in **less than a second**. Without the local audio server,
        fetching the audio can take anywhere from three seconds to a full minute
        (on particularly bad days).

        Most of the delay from Yomichan when creating cards is from fetching the audio.
        In other words, getting the audio is the main bottleneck of when creating Anki cards.
        This setup removes this bottleneck, and allows you to make cards **nearly instaneously**.

    1. If you do not have internet access, you can still add audio to your cards.

* **Disadvantages:**

    1. This setup requires a little over **5GB of free space**.

    1. This setup is only available for PC.
        However, a WIP PR is currently live on [AnkiConnectAndroid](https://github.com/KamWithK/AnkiconnectAndroid/pull/20),
        which means it will be available on Android in the future!

    1. It only has the coverage of JPod, NHK16 and select audio from Forvo
        (which is still about 99% coverage, from personal experience).
        To increase audio coverage,
        it would be ideal to also include an extra
        [Forvo audio source](https://learnjapanese.moe/yomichan/#bonus-adding-forvo-extra-audio-source).

<details> <summary>Notes on Forvo Audio Sourcing <i>(click here)</i></summary>

* The following is a slightly edited quote from person who got the Forvo audio:

    > The files for now only includes audio files with an exact 1:1 mapping of a dictionary/Marv's JPDB frequency list term to the name of the file the user uploaded. Just because you don't get audio for an user it does not mean the user has no audio on Forvo. Just because you get audio it does not mean it actually matches the current word/reading. It is also not uncommon that people pronounce multiple readings in the same file.

    The full quote can be found at the bottom of the page, under "Original Message for v09".

## Steps

1.  There are two main versions of the add-on. Download one of the two.

    - **Option 1**: [SQL-based](https://github.com/Aquafina-water-bottle/jmdict-english-yomichan/blob/master/local_audio/sql_09/localaudio_sql09__2023_01_24.ankiaddon?raw=true) (highly recommended, but requires Anki 2.1.50+)
    - **Option 2**: [Memory-based](https://github.com/Aquafina-water-bottle/jmdict-english-yomichan/blob/master/local_audio/09/localaudio_09__2023_01_15.ankiaddon?raw=true)

    If you are interested, here are the differences between the two versions:

    <details> <summary>Comparing Memory-based VS SQL-based versions <i>(click here)</i></summary>

    <br>

    > The SQL-based version stores the map in a local database file on your computer.
    > This version queries this database when fetching the audio.
    >
    > The memory-based version generates and caches the map in memory.
    > This is the original version of the add-on.
    > The SQL-based version is a patch on-top of this version.
    >
    > Advantages and disadvantages of each version:
    >
    > - The SQL-based version only works on Anki versions 2.1.50 and above.
    >
    > - The SQL database only has to be generated once, as this database is
    >     stored on the disk.
    >
    >     The memory-based version must regenerated its cache
    >     **every time you re-open Anki**.
    >     This indeed has noticable effects;
    >     the cache is only regenerated when audio is fetched,
    >     so the first card added after every Anki restart will take noticably longer than normal.
    >
    > - The memory-based version hogs about ~250MB of memory,
    >     which is a problem on slow computers.
    >     The SQL-based version does not hog memory.
    >
    > - The memory-based version is slightly faster than the SQL-based version, outside of the first card of each session.

1. Install the add-on by heading over to:

    > (Anki) →  `Tools` →  `Add-ons` →  `Install from file...`

1. Download all the required audio files.
    They can be found at this [torrent link](https://nyaa.si/view/1625597).

    </details>

1. Place the audio files under `Anki2/addons21/955441350/user_files`.
    See [Anki's documentation](https://docs.ankiweb.net/files.html#file-locations)
    on instructions to find your `Anki2` folder.

    Additionally, if you are using the memory-based version, place the `forvo.db` file
    under `Anki2/addons21/955441350` (NOT under the `user_files` folder).

    <details> <summary>Expected file structure <i>(click here)</i></summary>

                │   └── ...
                └── entries.json

    </summary>

1. In Yomichan Settings, go to:

    > `Audio` →  `Configure audio playback sources`.

    Click `Add`, and set the source to be `Add Custom URL (JSON)`.

    Set the `URL` field to:
    ```
    http://localhost:5050/?sources=jpod,jpod_alternate,nhk16,forvo&term={term}&reading={reading}
    ```

1. Restart Anki.

    If you are using the SQL-based version, restarting Anki will generate the database file.
    Expect this to take a while.

1. Ensure that everything works. To do this, play some audio from Yomichan.
    You should notice two things:

    - The audio should be played almost immediately after clicking the play button.
        Note that if you're using the memory based version,
        the first audio play will take a while to load as mentioned above (in the comparison).
    - After playing the audio, you should be able to see the available sources
        by right-clicking on the play button.

        Here is an example for 読む:

        ![image](./img/yomu.gif)

    Play all the sources from the above (読む) to ensure the sound is properly fetched.

    > **Note**: If some sources don't work (and you are using the sql version),
    > try deleting the `entries.db` file (under `Anki2/addons21/955441350/`),
    > restarting Anki, and playing the audio again.


## Usage Notes

* The local audio server only works when Anki is open. Of course, it can be running minimized in the background.

* The sources can be rearranged to give priority to a different source.
    For example, if you want Forvo to have the highest priority, use
    `sources=forvo,jpod,jpod_alternate,nhk16`
    (under the Custom URL step).

* For Forvo audio specifically, you can modify the priority of users by using `&user=`.

    For example, the following will get forvo audio in the priority of strawberrybrown, then akitomo. All other users **will not be included in the search**.
    ```
    http://localhost:5050/?sources=jpod,jpod_alternate,nhk16,forvo&term={term}&reading={reading}&user=strawberrybrown,akitomo
    ```

> Zetta — 16/02/2022 <br>
> Yomichan Local Audio Server Anki Plugin V0.1 (probably buggy) This plugin acts similar to the Forvo Audio Server plugin but runs off the downloaded JapanesePod audio files. The purpose is to provide offline access and faster look ups for audio that exists in the dump.
> 
> Any audio files with the format of `<reading> - <term>.mp3` under the plugins `user_files` directory will be used. Folder structure under `user_files` doesn’t matter. For example `よむ - 読む.mp3` it will try to match the yomichan entry to both reading and term and show up as `Local (Exact)` Failing that, it will just use `reading` and show up as `Local (Reading)` in the yomichan audio dropdown.
> 
> How to use:
> 
> 1. Install the attached addon like any other local addon.
> 1. Restart Anki
> 1. Allow network connections (required since this is a local server)
> 1. In yomichan settings, go to Audio > Configure Audio Playback Sources > Custom Audio Source
> 1. Select Type as JSON and set URL to `http://localhost:5050/?term={term}&reading={reading}`
> 1. Download the JapansePod Audio dump from here https://discord.com/channels/617136488840429598/778430038159655012/943679275884740608 and unzip all archives it in your Anki2 folder under `addons21/955441350/user_files`
> 1. (You may need to Restart Anki again if it doesn’t start working.)
> 
> Bugfix for multiple files named the same in different directories under user_files. https://discord.com/channels/617136488840429598/778430038159655012/943876430746513429 <br>

Just because you get audio it does not mean it actually matches the current word/reading (also not uncommon that people pronounce multiple readings in the same file). Maybe one day me or someone find a nice way to normalize the filenames and is in the mood to extend the script/files for better results/accuracy but for now you need to live with what you get : >

> Aquafina water bottle — 01/24/2023 <br>
> Out of pure stupidity, the jpod_alternate audio files aren't actually found in the `sql_09` version. If you already have it installed, here's how to hotfix it:
> 1. Download the new `__init__.py` file. You can find it in the zip below or at this link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aquafina-water-bottle/jmdict-english-yomichan/master/local_audio/sql_09/__init__.py
> 2. Navigate to `Anki2/addons21/955441350`
> 3. Replace the `__init__.py` file with the one downloaded from step 1.
> 4. Remove the `entries.db` file entirely.
> 5. Restart Anki. You should now be able to see 読む from all 4 sources. It should look like step 7 from the standard setup instructions: <https://github.com/Aquafina-water-bottle/jmdict-english-yomichan/tree/master/local_audio>
> 
> Worst case scenario, if the hotfix doesn't work, it's likely best to just re-do the setup process from scratch by deleting the addon and following the steps in the README. Make sure you save the `user_files` folder so you don't have to re-download any audio files.
