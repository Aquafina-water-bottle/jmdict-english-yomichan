Modified version of the
[Local audio server add-on](https://github.com/Aquafina-water-bottle/jmdict-english-yomichan/tree/master/local_audio/07)
that introduces support for Forvo audio.

Credits to Renji-xd for getting the Forvo audio and making it work with the add-on.

> **Note**: You must have the `forvo.db` file for this version of the add-on to work.
> This file is not provided with the repository nor is it generated from the add-on.
> If you want forvo audio support, use the sql_09 version.

I did NOT make this addon.
