Modified version of the
[Local audio server add-on](https://github.com/Aquafina-water-bottle/jmdict-english-yomichan/tree/master/local_audio/07)
that introduces SQL support.

The author that introduced SQL support does not want to be credited
(and can no longer be contacted).

I did NOT make this addon.
