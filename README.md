Contains a Yomichan dictionary version of `JMdict (English)`
from the [main website](https://www.edrdg.org/wiki/index.php/JMdict-EDICT_Dictionary_Project)
(from file `JMdict_e`),
created using [yomichan-import](https://github.com/FooSoft/yomichan-import).

This repository exists to simply give people a more up-to-date version of this dictionary,
because as of writing this, all of the following sources give relatively older versions:
- Matt's Yomichan video (Exact version not found, but likely before 2021)
- TMW (2021-01-01)
- Yomichan README (2021-01-01)
