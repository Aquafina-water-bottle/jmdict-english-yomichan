Contains a Yomichan dictionary version of `JMdict (English)`
from the [main website](https://www.edrdg.org/wiki/index.php/JMdict-EDICT_Dictionary_Project)
(from file `JMdict_e`),
compiled using [yomichan-import](https://github.com/FooSoft/yomichan-import).

This repository exists to simply give people a more up-to-date version of this dictionary,
for people who don't want to compile the dictionary themselves.
A more up-to-date version of JMdict usually provides better definitions and coverage
compared to older versions, so I would recommend updating this dictionary every few months.

There are now two versions:
* `jmdict_english`: The default version.
* `jmdict_english_extra`: Contains a lot of extra information not included in the default version,
    including alternate forms and antonyms.
    See [here](https://github.com/FooSoft/yomichan-import/pull/40) for more info.

    Note that this version will take considerably longer to import compared to the default version.

Additionally, as of writing this (2022/09/20),
all of the following sources provide relatively older versions of JMdict:
- Matt's Yomichan video (Exact version not included, but likely before 2021)
- TMW's Google Drive folder (2021-01-01)
- Yomichan README (2021-01-01)

To see your current version of `JMdict (English)`,
hover over this entry:

In the future, I plan on writing something to automatically re-compile this dictionary daily / weekly.
