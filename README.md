Contains a Yomichan dictionary version of `JMdict (English)`
from the [main website](https://www.edrdg.org/wiki/index.php/JMdict-EDICT_Dictionary_Project)
(from file `JMdict_e`),
compiled using [yomichan-import](https://github.com/FooSoft/yomichan-import).

This repository exists to simply give people a more up-to-date version of this dictionary,
for people who don't want to compile the dictionary themselves.
A more up-to-date version of JMdict usually provides better definitions and coverage
compared to older versions, so I would recommend updating this dictionary every few months.

Additionally, as of writing this (2022/09/20),
all of the following sources provide relatively older versions of JMdict:
- Matt's Yomichan video (Exact version not included, but likely before 2021)
- TMW's Google Drive folder (2021-01-01)
- Yomichan README (2021-01-01)

> **Note**
>
> In the future, I plan on writing something to re-compile the dictionary daily / weekly.
